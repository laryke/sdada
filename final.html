        <span class="bold">The great white shark </span>(Carcharodon Carcharias), also known as <span class="bold">the great white, white shark</span>
        <span class="bold">"white pointer"</span>, is a species of large mackerel shark which can be found in the coastal surface waters of all the major oceans. It is notable for its size, with larger female individuals growing to 6.1 m (20 ft) in length and 1,905–2,268 kg (4,200–5,000 lb.) in weight at maturity.
        <br />According to a 2014 study, the lifespan of great white sharks is estimated to be as
        long as 70 years or more, well above previous estimates, making it one of the longest lived cartilaginous fish currently known.
        <br />
        The great white shark has no known natural predators other than, on very rare occasions, the killer whale. It is arguably the world's largest-known extant macropredator fish, and is one of the primary predators of marine mammals, up to the size of large baleen whales.  
        This shark is also known to prey upon a variety of other marine animals, including fish, and seabirds. It is the only known surviving species of its genus <span class="italic">Carcharodon</span>, and is responsible for more recorded human bite incidents than any other shark.
